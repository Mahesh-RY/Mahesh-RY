## 🚀 About Me  

I’m Mahesh — a **final-year B.Tech (AI & ML) student** with 1+ year of experience in **AI tech support, international client communication, and B2B project coordination**.  

My journey started as an **intern during my second year**, where I worked hard enough to be offered a role at GAOTek Inc. Over time, I grew into an **AI Tech Support role**, leading international interns, solving technical issues, and delivering AI-driven projects for business and research needs.  

I love building **practical AI/ML solutions** — from **predictive models** to **end-to-end deployed apps**. My focus is on making AI not just a buzzword, but something that **solves real problems** in healthcare, environment, and business.
